title: LetsEncrypt
description: 'Securing your ThRadio installation with SSL / HTTPS'
category: 'Getting started'
features:
    - Secure your connection to ThRadio when administering your stations.
    - Enforce security for all ThRadio administrators via HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), and
    - Provide a secure listening endpoint to listeners, avoiding "Mixed Content" warnings when your radio signal is played from a secure web page.
considerations:
    - ThRadio uses a reverse proxy by Caddy, if you wish to configure LetsEncrypt you must have a domain (e.g. mysite.com) or a subdomain (radio.mysite.com) configured to point to the IP of your ThRadio installation.
    - ThRadio's web server must be served on the default ports, 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS
