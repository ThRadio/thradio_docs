ThRadio is powered by Docker and uses pre-built images that contain every component of the software

<alert type="info">
Installing ThRadio yourself requires a basic understanding of the Linux shell/terminal environment, as well as root (or "sudo") access to the computer you're installing ThRadio on.
</alert>

## Docker

Pick a base directory on your host computer that ThRadio can use. If you're on Linux, you can follow the steps below to use the recommended directory:

```bash
mkdir -p /var/thradio
cd /var/thradio
```

Use these commands to download our Docker Utility Script, set it as executable and then run the Docker installation process:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThRadio/ThRadio/main/thradio.sh > thradio.sh
chmod a+x thradio.sh
./thradio.sh install
```
